## Overview

**LavaLust** is an open-source PHP framework that follows the **MVC (Model–View–Controller)** architectural pattern. It is designed for developers who need a structured, maintainable, and scalable foundation — without the bloat of heavier modern frameworks.

Whether you are building a simple web application, a REST API, or a teaching project, LavaLust provides the right tools with minimal friction.

---

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **MVC Architecture** | Clean separation of Models, Views, and Controllers for organized, maintainable code |
| **Built-in Routing** | Flexible URL routing that maps requests to controllers with minimal configuration |
| **Libraries & Helpers** | Reusable components for sessions, forms, validation, and database access |
| **Modular Design** | Scalable structure that supports clean organization as your application grows |
| **REST API Support** | First-class support for building RESTful APIs using LavaLust conventions |
| **ORM-like Models** | Simplified, readable database interaction without a heavy abstraction layer |

---

## Requirements

- PHP 7.4 or higher
- A web server with URL rewriting support (Apache `.htaccess` or Nginx config)
- Composer (optional, for dependency management)

---

## Installation

**Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ronmarasigan/lavalust.git
cd lavalust
```

**Or download a release directly:**

```bash
wget https://github.com/ronmarasigan/lavalust/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
unzip main.zip
```

Configure your web server to point to the project root and ensure `mod_rewrite` (Apache) or equivalent is enabled.

## Quick Start

### 1. Define a Route

**File:** `app/config/routes.php`

```php
$router->get('/', 'Welcome::index');
$router->get('/about', 'Welcome::about');
$router->post('/users/store', 'Users::store');
```

### 2. Create a Controller

**File:** `app/controllers/Welcome.php`

```php
<?php

class Welcome extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        $data['title'] = 'Home';
        $this->call->view('welcome', $data);
    }

    public function about()
    {
        $this->call->view('about');
    }
}
```

### 3. Create a View

**File:** `app/views/welcome.php`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title><?= $title ?></title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to LavaLust Framework</h1>
    <p>Lightweight. Fast. MVC.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### 4. Create a Model

**File:** `app/models/User_model.php`

```php
<?php

class User_model extends Model
{
    protected $table = 'users';

    public function getAll()
    {
        return $this->db->table($this->table)->get()->getResult();
    }

    public function findById(int $id)
    {
        return $this->db->table($this->table)
                        ->where('id', $id)
                        ->get()
    }
}
```

## Configuration

### Database

**File:** `app/config/database.php`

```php
$database['main'] = array(
    'driver'	=> getenv('DB_DRIVER') ?: '',
    'hostname'	=> getenv('DB_HOST') ?: '',
    'port'		=> getenv('DB_PORT') ?: '',
    'username'	=> getenv('DB_USER') ?: '',
    'password'	=> getenv('DB_PASSWORD') ?: '',
    'database'	=> getenv('DB_NAME') ?: '',
    'charset'	=> getenv('DB_CHARSET') ?: '',
    'dbprefix'	=> getenv('DB_PREFIX') ?: '',
    // Optional for SQLite
    'path'      => ''
);
```

### Base URL

**File:** `app/config/config.php`

```php
$config['base_url'] = 'http://localhost:3000/';
```

---

## Building a REST API

LavaLust supports REST API development out of the box. Controllers can return JSON responses for API endpoints.

```php
<?php

class Api extends Controller
{
    $this->call->library('api');

    public function users()
    {
        $this->api->require_method('GET');
        $auth = $this->api->require_jwt(); 

        $this->call->model('User_model');
        $users = $this->User_model->getAll();

        $this->api->respond(['data' => $users]);
    }
}
```

Route definition:

```php
$router->get('/api/users', 'Api::users');
```

## Laboratory Exercise 6: Authenticated Product CRUD

This repository now includes a React inventory frontend in `frontend/` and a
LavaLust JSON API. The API stores data in the Aiven MySQL database selected by
`DB_NAME` and never exposes a database connection to the frontend.

### Local setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, then set the Aiven host, port, user, password,
   and database. Keep `.env` private; it is ignored by Git and excluded from the
   Docker image.
2. Set separate random values of at least 32 characters for `JWT_SECRET` and
   `REFRESH_TOKEN_KEY`. Generate each with `php -r "echo bin2hex(random_bytes(32));"`.
3. Keep `DB_SSL_REQUIRED=1` for Aiven. Set `DB_SSL_CA` to a CA bundle file if
   your local MySQL driver requires one. Set `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN` to
   `http://localhost:5173` for local frontend development.
4. Apply the schema to the configured database:

   ```sh
   php lava migration run
   ```

5. Start the API and frontend in separate terminals:

   ```sh
   php lava serve --port=3000
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Open the Vite URL (normally `http://localhost:5173`) and create an account
   from the sign-in screen.

### API routes

| Method | Route | Authentication |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/api/auth/register` | Public |
| POST | `/api/auth/login` | Public |
| POST | `/api/auth/refresh` | Refresh token |
| POST | `/api/auth/logout` | Bearer access token |
| GET | `/api/auth/me` | Bearer access token |
| GET | `/api/products` | Bearer access token |
| GET | `/api/products/{id}` | Bearer access token |
| POST | `/api/products` | Bearer access token |
| PUT/PATCH | `/api/products/{id}` | Bearer access token |
| DELETE | `/api/products/{id}` | Bearer access token |

Register and login return short-lived JWT access tokens and refresh tokens.
Product endpoints reject requests without a valid bearer access token. Product
fields are validated server-side. The frontend refreshes expired access tokens
and sends all product requests to the API.

### Render deployment

The root `render.yaml` defines a Docker-based LavaLust API and a static React
site. Push the repository to GitHub, create a Render Blueprint from it, then
provide the requested environment values in Render:

- API `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_USER`, and `DB_PASSWORD` from Aiven.
- API `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGIN` set to the deployed frontend's HTTPS origin.
- Frontend `VITE_API_URL` set to the API URL followed by `/api`.

Render generates separate JWT and refresh-token secrets. Keep the Aiven
database password and all production secrets in Render's environment settings,
not in the repository. Apply migrations to the target Aiven database with
`php lava migration run` before deploying the API. The production database
must be the `lavalust6` database (or update `DB_NAME` in Render accordingly).

The previous development-only migration web routes are intentionally not
registered: schema rollback actions must not be exposed as unauthenticated
production endpoints.

## Philosophy

LavaLust is built on a single principle: **minimal core, maximum control.**

Modern frameworks often add layers of abstraction that benefit large enterprise teams but get in the way of developers who want to understand exactly what their code is doing. LavaLust provides structure and utilities without hiding the underlying logic — making it an excellent choice for:

- **Rapid prototyping** — Get an application running in minutes
- **Learning MVC** — Understand how each architectural layer works
- **Lightweight production apps** — Deploy without dragging in unused dependencies
- **Teaching PHP development** — Clear conventions, readable source code
